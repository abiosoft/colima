### Developer Certificate of Origin

Every commit must be signed off with the `Signed-off-by: REAL NAME <email@example.com>` line.

Use the `git commit -s` command to add the Signed-off-by line.

### Licensing

Colima is licensed under the terms of [MIT License](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima/blob/main/LICENSE).

### Sending pull requests

Pull requests can be submitted to <https://github.com/abiosoft/colima/pulls>.

It is highly suggested to add tests for every non-trivial pull request.
A test can be implemented as a unit test rather than an integration test when possible,
to avoid slowing the integration test CI.

### Code review process

Pull requests require approval from project maintainers before merging.

Maintainers shouldn't merge their own pull requests without approval from at least one other maintainer.

This rule does not apply to trivial pull requests such as fixing typos or CI failures.
