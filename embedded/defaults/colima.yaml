# Number of CPUs to be allocated to the virtual machine.
# Default: 2
cpu: 2

# Size of the disk in GiB to be allocated to the virtual machine.
# NOTE: changing this has no effect after the virtual machine has been created.
# Default: 60
disk: 60

# Size of the memory in GiB to be allocated to the virtual machine.
# Default: 2
memory: 2

# Architecture of the virtual machine (x86_64, aarch64, host).
# Default: host
arch: host

# Container runtime to be used (docker, containerd).
# Default: docker
runtime: docker

# Kubernetes configuration for the virtual machine.
kubernetes:
  # Enable kubernetes.
  # Default: false
  enabled: false

  # Kubernetes version to use.
  # This needs to exactly match a k3s version https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases
  # Default: latest stable release
  version: v1.24.3+k3s1

  # Enable the traefik ingress controller
  # Default: false
  ingress: false

# Auto-activate on the Host for client access.
# Setting to true does the following on startup
#  - sets as active Docker context (for Docker runtime).
#  - sets as active Kubernetes context (if Kubernetes is enabled).
# Default: true
autoActivate: true

# Network configurations for the virtual machine.
network:
  # Assign reachable IP address to the virtual machine.
  # NOTE: this is currently macOS only and ignored on Linux.
  # Default: false
  address: false

  # Custom DNS nameservers for the virtual machine.
  #
  # EXAMPLE
  # dns: [1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8]
  #
  # Default: []
  dns: []

  # Network driver to use (slirp, gvproxy)
  #   - slirp is the default user mode networking provided by Qemu
  #   - gvproxy is an alternative to VPNKit based on gVisor https://github.com/containers/gvisor-tap-vsock
  # Default: gvproxy
  driver: gvproxy

# ===================================================================== #
# ADVANCED CONFIGURATION
# ===================================================================== #

# Forward the host's SSH agent to the virtual machine.
# Default: false
forwardAgent: false

# Docker daemon configuration that maps directly to daemon.json.
# https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-configuration-file.
# NOTE: some settings may affect Colima's ability to start docker. e.g. `hosts`.
#
# EXAMPLE - disable buildkit
# docker:
#   features:
#     buildkit: false
#
# EXAMPLE - add insecure registries
# docker:
#   insecure-registries:
#     - myregistry.com:5000
#     - host.docker.internal:5000
#
# Colima default behaviour: buildkit enabled
# Default: {}
docker: {}

# Volume mount driver for the virtual machine (sshfs, 9p).
#
# 9p is more POSIX compliant and generally handles file permissions better.
# However, it does not properly resolve symlinks (that are created on host).
#
# sshfs is faster than 9p but less reliable when there are lots
# of concurrent reads or writes.
#
# Default: sshfs
mountType: sshfs

# The CPU type for the virtual machine.
# Options available for host emulation can be checked with: `qemu-system-$(arch) -cpu help`.
# Instructions are also supported by appending to the cpu type e.g. "qemu64,+ssse3".
# Default: host
cpuType: host

# For a more general purpose virtual machine, Ubuntu container is optionally provided
# as a layer on the virtual machine.
# The underlying virtual machine is still accessible via `colima ssh --layer=false` or running `colima` in
# the Ubuntu session.
#
# Default: false
layer: false

# Custom provision scripts for the virtual machine.
# Provisioning scripts are executed on startup and therefore needs to be idempotent.
#
# Example - script exected as root
# provision:
#   - mode: system
#     script: apk add htop vim
#
# Example - script exected as user
# provision:
#   - mode: user
#     script: |
#       [ -f ~/.provision ] && exit 0;
#       echo provisioning as $USER...
#       touch ~/.provision
#
# Default: []
provision: []

# Configure volume mounts for the virtual machine.
# Colima mounts user's home directory by default to provide a familiar
# user experience.
#
# EXAMPLE
# mounts:
#   - location: ~/secrets
#     writable: false
#   - location: ~/projects
#     writable: true
#
# Colima default behaviour: $HOME and /tmp/colima are mounted as writable.
# Default: []
mounts: []

# Environment variables for the virtual machine.
#
# EXAMPLE
# env:
#   KEY: value
#   ANOTHER_KEY: another value
#
# Default: {}
env: {}
