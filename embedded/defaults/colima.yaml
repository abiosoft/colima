# Number of CPUs to be allocated to the virtual machine.
# Default: 2
cpu: 2

# Size of the disk in GiB to be allocated to the virtual machine.
# NOTE: changing this has no effect after the virtual machine has been created.
# Default: 60
disk: 60

# Size of the memory in GiB to be allocated to the virtual machine.
# Default: 2
memory: 2

# Architecture of the virtual machine (x86_64, aarch64, host).
# Default: host
arch: host

# Container runtime to be used (docker, containerd).
# Default: docker
runtime: docker

# Kubernetes configuration for the virtual machine.
kubernetes:
  # Enable kubernetes.
  # Default: false
  enabled: false

  # Kubernetes version to use.
  # This needs to exactly match a k3s version https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases
  # Default: latest stable release
  version: v1.23.4+k3s1

# Custom DNS nameservers for the virtual machine.

#   - 1.1.1.1
#   - 8.8.8.8
#
# Default: null
dns: null

# The CPU type for the QEMU instance.
# You can see what options are available for host emulation with: `qemu-system-$(arch) -cpu help`.
# Setting of instructions is supported like this: "qemu64,+ssse3".
# Default: host
cpuType: host

# Network configuration for the virtual machine.
# NOTE: this is macOS only and ignored on Linux.
network:
  # Assign reachable IP address to the virtual machine.
  # Default: true
  address: true

  # Use QEMU user mode (slirp) network as the default route (i.e. for internet).
  #
  # Setting `address` to true provides additional option of using the address' network
  # as the default route, which has proven to be more reliable in some cases.
  # However, it seems to perform worse with VPN enabled.
  #
  # This setting is ignored if `address` is false.
  # Default: true
  userMode: true

# Forward the host's SSH agent to the virtual machine.
# Default: false
forward_agent: false

# Environment variables for the virtual machine.
#
# EXAMPLE
# env:
#   KEY: value
#   ANOTHER_KEY: another value
#
# Default: null
env: null

# Configure volume mounts for the virtual machine.
# Writable mounts are denoted with `:w` suffix.
#
# EXAMPLE
# mounts:
#   - ~/secrets    # readonly
#   - ~/projects:w # writable
#
# Colima default behavour: $HOME is mounted as writable.
# Default: null
mounts: null
